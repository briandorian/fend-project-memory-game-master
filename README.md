# FEND PROJECT MEMORY GAME 

Repository created to practice a bit with JS events in a memory game. Classic Memory Game

# How to play

Clicking on the  tiles will turn them over so that you can see what lies on them. Your goal is to match two tiles of the same type at a time. Then try to match all pairs in as minimum moves as possible and as minimum time as possible.

# Known issues (TODO)
Improve the internal behavior of the timer. Not really happy how it behaves. (not wrong, just don't like the logic). 

# Dependencies
All the initial html and css code was provided by udacity.com , so credit goes to them. The rest is pretty much handcrafted with a few searches on the internet mainly stackoverflow.
