Repository created to practice a bit with JS events in a memory game. 
Classic Memory Game

How to play
Clicking on tiles will turn them over so that you can see what lies on them.
Your goal is to match two tiles of the same type at a time.
Then try to match all pairs in as minimum moves as possible.

Known issues (TODO)
  - Two clicks on the same card leads to misbehave
  - Clicking around too fast without waiting for the timeout function also makes the system misbehave
